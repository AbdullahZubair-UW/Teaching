\end{center}

In this grammar lesson, we will learn how to correctly use the semicolon. Before doing so, lets practice some rules about the comma we learnt from yesterday. 

\section*{Practice - Commma:}
Fro each of the following quotes, identify which rule the placement of the comma in the sentence satisfies. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item "In this grammar lesson, we will learn how to correctly use the semicolon."
  \item "You may pass, or fail."
  \item "The Toronto Raptors, the underrated, surprised northern America by winning their first ever championship in 2019.
  \item "Amongst my favorite students I have ever taught were Alex, Sam, Kurt and Nolan."
  \item "Ryan, who was wearing a black tie today, was throwing up after dinner."
  \item "That's spelled incoractly!", Qaasim proclaimed, "You should be fired!". 
  \item John, your right.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Lecture - Semicolons}
