\begin{verse}[400em]
  \Large{We heard the songs of a wedding party.} \\
  \Large{We saw a soft light}\\
  \Large{Coiling round the young blades of grass}\\
  \Large{At first we hesitated, then we saw her footprints,}\\
  \Large{Her face emerged, then her eyes of freedom!}\\
  \Large{She woke us up with a smile saying,}\\
  \Large{'What day is this that comes suddenly?'}\\
  \Large{We said, 'It is the first day after the war'.}\\
  \Large{Then without waiting we ran to the open space}\\
  \Large{Ululating to the mountains and the pathways}\\
  \Large{Calling people from all circles of the earth.}\\
  \Large{We shook up the old man demanding a festival}\\
  \Large{We asked for all the first fruits of the season.}\\
  \Large{We held hands with a stranger}\\
  \Large{We shouted across the waterfalls}\\
  \Large{People came from all lands}\\
  \Large{It was the first day of peace.}\\
  \Large{We saw our Ancestors travelling tall on the horizon.}
